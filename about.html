      <p>
        <strong>Code for San Francisco</strong> is a group of people, first and foremost. We also call ourselves
        technologists, planners, designers, doers, thinkers, and activists. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/events">Each
        week</a>, we actively work together to improve the City and County of San Francisco, often <a
        href="https://github.com/sfbrigade">using technology</a> to support our efforts. By connecting people,
        organizations, resources, tools, and networks to build for San Francisco, we will all thrive.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Code for San Francisco</strong> is a safe space for experimentation, learning and practicing skills,
        taking chances, and asking questions, all to affect and encourage positive change. Whenever possible, we
        proactively reach out to those who are left out, excluded, ignored, or discriminated against. Those people, in our
        opinion, represent our most desirable source for experiences, knowledge, and thoughts. We fail without their
        involvement.

      <h3 id='what-happens'>What happens at a hack night?</h3>

      <p>
        Code for San Francisco starts every Wednesday at 6 PM at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/fEy5XnYsquE2">Code for
        America's HQ</a>. The event is free, and the invitation is open to anyone, especially folks who are not
        programmers.
      </p>

      <p>Here's what happens at Code for San Francisco every week (see event page for each week for details):</p>

      <h4>6:00pm – Socializing and food</h4>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            As people arrive, we gather on the first floor of Code for America's offices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Because we’re meeting during the dinner hour, food is always provided, usually pizza. We want to make sure
            people are happy and fed, and eating together is a great way to break the ice and bond with other
            attendees. This is time for everyone to get to know each other.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>6:30pm – Welcoming remarks</h4>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            We get started around 6:30pm with a brief welcome and introduction to the event.
          </p>

          <p>
            Next, we hold an open floor for announcements for civic tech and open government related things. This could
            be plugging other events, mentioning newsworthy articles, and job announcements in the
            government and civic tech space.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following this present projects are encouraged to give a short 30 second pitch to share: project background
            for new members, any updates, and specific needs they have for the evening.
          </p>

          <p>
            Short presentations (&lt; 5 minutes) also happen during this section. Often times these are projects
            presenting their work, but could be on anything civic tech related. These are not always scheduled ahead of
            time, but we do encourage you to <a href="mailto:hello@codeforsanfrancisco.org">reach out to us</a> before
            the event to ensure we have time for everyone interested.
          </p>

          <p>
            We record these announcements in our weekly meeting notes and agenda Google Doc. Here’s an example from
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EtcdjCHDInWHf6ArgD1C3BgVcOxRQxToS2wpbTVGUp8/edit">our
              11/1/2017 hack night</a>.

            <div class="caption">

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>7:00pm – Presentation with Q&amp;A</h4>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">

          <p>
            Occasionally we will have longer form presentations that range from 15 minutes to 45 minutes, with an open
            question &amp; answer (Q&amp;A) session after.
          </p>

          <p>
            Presenters can be any government agency, non-profit, company or group who've made use of open government data
            or built a civic technology application. Anyone can propose a talk, and we often reach out to presenters who
            would be a good fit. For every speaker, we provide some clear <a href="{{ site.baseurl
            }}/speaker-submissions">speaker guidelines</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="thumbnail">
            <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/about/presentation.jpg" alt="Presentation at Hack Night" />

        </div>
      </div>

      <h4>~7:30pm - 9:30pm – Hack time</h4>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            Once the opening wraps up, the format of the event opens up to allow people to get together and:
            <ul>
              <li>Work on projects</li>
              <li>Start something new</li>
              <li>Discuss civic tech in the bay area and at large</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Anyone is welcome to start a new project. The only requirement is that you take ownership of the group and
            make an honest attempt to keep showing up every week.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">

        </div>

      <p>
        When 9:30pm rolls around, we all head home and do it all over again next week.

      <h3 id='everyone'>Everyone is welcome!</h3>

      <p>
        Not a techie? <strong>That's ok!</strong> We encourage non-technical folks to pair up and learn from our
        community's designers and developers. We've seen time and time again, the most successful <a href='{{ site.baseurl
        }}/projects'>projects</a> come from teams with a diverse background.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Remember</strong>, there's much more to making a great project than just coding. Not the least of which,
        there is also:

        <ul>
          <li>User research</li>
          <li>Product management</li>
          <li>Project management</li>
          <li>Community engagement</li>
          <li>Promotion</li>
        </ul>

        And much more!
