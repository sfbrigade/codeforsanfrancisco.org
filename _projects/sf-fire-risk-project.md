[SF Fire Risk Carto Visualization](https://sf-fire-risk.carto.com/builder/c3e7dcb0-0acd-4575-9011-a9240208cd49)

This project attempts to model and acquire data from SF OpenData - and other sources - to predict the relative risk of fire in San Francisco’s buildings and public spaces.

The mapping software allows users to type in an address and see fire-related risks and incidences around their area, using predictive modeling driven by data science and data analysis.

This project is modeled after [Data Science for Social Good's (DSSG) Firebird Project](http://firebird.gatech.edu/) in Atlanta, GA.  Consultation is occasionally provided by members of the DSSG and former members of the Atlanta project.
