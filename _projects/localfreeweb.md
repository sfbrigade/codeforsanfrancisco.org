LocalFreeWeb
===========

A resource directory of sites that provide free access to internet enabled
computers in San Francisco.

PLEASE NOTE:
This repository only includes a Flask app, addlocation.py that is executed via
a command prompt and run on local host, for adding additional entries to our
network of locations that provide free access to internet enabled computers
and a PDF with our flier in English, Mandarin and Spanish.

Here is our git repository for our text messaging app:
https://github.com/sfbrigade/localfreeweb-sms-api

Here is our git repository for our website LocalFreeWeb.org:
https://github.com/sfbrigade/localfreeweb.org

In addition, the following resources have been used:

SFMTA transit data that includes a list of all bus stops and their meta data
ie; address, ID, Geocode. This is updated roughly every three months.
Here is the website to access it:
http://www.sfmta.com/about-sfmta/reports/gtfs-transit-data

EveryOneOn.org has a json file that can be accessed of their locations
in and around SF: 
http://api.everyoneon.org/json.php?zip=94109&distance=20&limit=500
