##About the Project

The SF Open Referral project is part of a larger movement to collect raw data about social services, including where they are and what they offer to whom, and transform it into a standard that can be shared broadly through any tool that supports the emerging [Open Referral Specification.](https://github.com/codeforamerica/OpenReferral/blob/master/README.md)  

An additional aim of this project is to automate how service organizations collect and update their information by using the [Ohana API](https://github.com/sfbrigade/ohana-api) to send the now standardized data into individually maintained service provider databases. Ohana is the product of the 2013 Code for America fellowship project in San Mateo County, which also produced [SMC-Connect](http://www.smc-connect.org/). This project is based on these earlier efforts.
