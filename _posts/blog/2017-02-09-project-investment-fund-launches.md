## Project Investment Fund Launches Today

Code for San Francisco is happy to announce we are launching a new partnership with Microsoft to support the work of our volunteers. Beginning today, projects organized through Code for San Francisco can apply to access up to $2,000 to spend on anything they need to build stronger solutions; e.g. web hosting, training, data processing, user testing, or more! We are excited to begin this new experiment and look forward to seeing where it leads.

The goal of the Project Investment Fund goal is to enable projects to reach their milestones,and to design projects beyond what can be built for free. Microsoft suggested this idea late in 2016 and Code for San Francisco is glad to be the first brigade to pilot this new funding program. 

If you think your project could benefit from financial support, please read on!

## The details
Applications to this program will be accepted triannually. The first application window opens on February 8th and closes on March 8th.

We are only taking online applications. We have created an [application template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HLT9ytbFtmnw6UAk2j0JI5vgmIY3_m2o88bsgcpnlbo/edit) to provide project teams with a clear idea of what to prepare before submitting an application. Applications can be submitted through the google form [available here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_TMVKYkSH4X0kssx-9_VnOkuUgH-wwdYwCoKLSTeCiOzx3w/viewform?c=0&w=1)

**The review panel will complete their selections from the first round and notify projects on March 29th.**

Projects interested in applying should review the [Program Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C2kpmXhWzd_4kauy3sZhCWKBtHHKfv4fTHICjgMIMjc/edit#heading=h.6qz9rr99awes) for more details on how applications will be evaluated and the process of participating in the Project Investment Fund. Feel free to [contact the core team](mail-to:coreteam@codeforsanfrancisco.org) with any questions or concerns on this new program; we welcome your input.

We believe our volunteers will come up with creative and valuable ways to use this resource. Microsoft has long been a key sponsor of Code for San Francisco and the Project Investment Fund is possible entirely through their support. Thank you again, Microsoft!
